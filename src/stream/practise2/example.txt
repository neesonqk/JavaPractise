Sherlock Holmes (/ˈʃɜːrlɒk ˈhoʊmz/) is a fictional private
detective created by British author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.
Known as a "consulting detective" in the stories, Holmes is
known for a proficiency with observation, forensic science,
and logical reasoning that borders on the fantastic, which
he employs when investigating cases for a wide variety of
clients, including Scotland Yard. First appearing in print in
1887, the character's popularity became widespread with the
first series of short stories in The Strand Magazine, beginning
with "A Scandal in Bohemia" in 1891; additional stories
appeared from then to 1927, eventually totalling four novels
and 56 short stories. All but one are set in the Victorian or
Edwardian periods, taking place between about 1880 to 1914.
Most are narrated by the character of Holmes's friend and
biographer Dr. Watson, who usually accompanies
Holmes during his investigations and often shares
quarters with him at the address of 221B Baker Street,
London, where many of the stories begin.
Though not the first fictional detective, Sherlock Holmes is
arguably the most well-known, with Guinness World Records
listing him as the "most portrayed movie character"
in history.[1] Holmes's popularity and fame are such
that many have believed him to be not a fictional
character but a real individual;[2][3][4] numerous literary
and fan societies have been founded that pretend to operate
on this principle. The stories and character have had a
profound and lasting effect on mystery writing and popular
culture as a whole, with both the original tales as well
as thousands written by authors other than Conan Doyle being
adapted into stage and radio plays, television, films, video games,
and other media for over one hundred years.
